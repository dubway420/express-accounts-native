# Install Docker

Go to the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/), install and run it. When it is running, you should  see a yellow bar in the bottom left corner with the Docker symbol on it - this means Docker is running.

# Make a Docker Hub account and log in via the application

Go to the [Docker Hub Website](https://hub.docker.com/) and create an account. Once your account is created, you should be able to now log in via the Docker application.

# Pull a Docker Image to your computer

The next thing you are going to do is download a Docker image to your computer. Think of a Docker image as like a copy of an entire computer - all the same files and programmes will be on this image. It will allow us to produce our application in the exact same computer environment. 

On Docker Hub, there are thousands of images which are used for all sorts of things. Take a browse through the images on Docker Hub - you can do this via the webiste or the Docker application. Pick an image you like the look of, maybe one with something to do with JavaScript. 

One you've picked a Docker image, your task is to pull this image to your computer. This is quite a simple thing to do, but might be a bit of a challenge if you've never done anything like this before. 

You might be able to figure out how to do it by messing around in the Docker application, or you can look it up on a website.

Hint: there's more than one way to do it. You can do it via the Docker application or via a command line interface such as Windows Powershell.
